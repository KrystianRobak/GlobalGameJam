# Dust Cleaner: The Last Janitor of the Cosmos

Welcome to the sweet yet tainted universe of "Dust Cleaner"! Step into the boots of the last cosmic janitor, tasked with restoring the brilliance of candy-coated planets, overrun by a mysterious "filthy blight."

## Lore and Story:

Once brimming with joy and sweetness, the Candy Worlds were the heart of the universe's delight. Lollipop forests, caramel rivers, and gummy palaces shimmered like jewels. Alas, a terrible disaster transformed this paradise into a nightmare.

The "Great Contamination" began with whispers—a strange brown goo oozing from candy cores, followed by a thick layer of dust settling over the once-vibrant landscapes. Sweetness turned sour. Fudgy corruption spread like a plague. People fled, leaving their worlds to decay.

Now, once-crisp candy canes splinter with filth. Donut cities have collapsed under layers of grime. Chocolate rivers flow with rancid sludge. The universe's most beloved treats are rotting from the inside—and only one man can scrub away the filth and restore the candy to its former glory.
